Considerations for premenopausal women: During the follicular phase, women should focus on higher carbohydrate intake due to improved insulin sensitivity, while maintaining moderate protein levels to support muscle growth. In the luteal phase, as insulin sensitivity decreases, reduce carbohydrate intake and increase protein and healthy fats to support muscle maintenance and counteract the catabolic effects of progesterone.

Supplements: Luteal phase: magnesium, Ashwagandha, Rhodiola Rosea, sodium, potassium can help reduce stress, balancing hormones, reduce PMS-related fatigue, and combat water retention and bloating.

Considerations for postmenopausal women: Increasing protein intake is crucial to support muscle mass and counteract the effects of declining estrogen, which can lead to muscle loss. Calcium and vitamin D intake should be prioritized to help maintain bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis, as well as healthy fats to support cardiovascular health.

Supplements: calcium (1000-1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (2000 IU/day)
