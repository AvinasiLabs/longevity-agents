Mental and emotional health are just as crucial as physical health when it comes to longevity and quality of life, affecting everything from our resilience to stress to our ability to find meaning and purpose. Prioritizing practices that support mental well-being, such as mindfulness, therapy, and strong relationships, is essential for a balanced and fulfilling life.

## Quality of life
Quality of life is at the core of everything we do to improve health and longevity; itâ€™s not just about adding years to life but ensuring those years are vibrant and fulfilling. By focusing on quality of life improvements, we can create a life that is both long and rich in meaningful experiences.

## Trauma & therapy
Addressing trauma through therapy can play an important role in our overall health, as unresolved emotional wounds can significantly impact physical well-being, resilience, and longevity. Therapy provides the tools needed to process and heal from past experiences, allowing us to lead fuller, healthier lives with greater emotional balance and mental clarity.

## Relationships
Good relationships are a cornerstone of a healthy, fulfilling life, profoundly influencing both our emotional well-being and physical health. Strong connections with others provide support, reduce stress, and contribute to a sense of purpose, all of which play an essential role in promoting longevity and overall quality of life.
