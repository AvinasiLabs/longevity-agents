Longevity is a multifaceted pursuit that combines lifestyle, medicine, and preventive care to extend both lifespan and healthspan. A comprehensive longevity approach involves optimizing physical, mental, and emotional health, recognizing that each of these areas contributes to resilience, vitality, and a life that is rich in both years and quality.

In this special episode, Peter provides a comprehensive introduction to longevity, perfect for newcomers or those looking to refresh their knowledge. He lays out the foundational concepts of lifespan, healthspan, and the marginal decade. Additionally, Peter discusses the four main causes of death and their prevention, as well as detailing the five key strategies in his longevity toolkit to improve lifespan and healthspan. Detailed show notes provide links for deeper exploration of these topics, making it an ideal starting point for anyone interested in understanding and improving their longevity.

## How Peter defines longevity

How do you define the word longevity?
It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot, and it means different things to different people
Peter tends to think of thing mathematically, and longevity is made up of 2 vectors: lifespan and healthspan
Lifespan is much easier to understand because it is discrete, it is binary, it is objective
For the most part, you’re either alive or you’re dead
Think of it through the lens of a death certificate
An edge-case would be an individual who is brain-dead but being kept alive (we could debate whether that person is dead or alive)
Notice that lifespan says nothing about the quality of a person’s life
Lifespan is one of the vectors of longevity
In as much as we want to increase longevity, we presumably want to have something to do with increasing lifespan
The second vector that makes up this longevity function is the healthspan vector
Healthspan is far more complicated to explain
It is far more subjective
It is analog as opposed to digital, meaning it is not discrete on, off
It is variable
Peter likes to think about it as having 3 components: a physical component, a cognitive component, and an emotional component
In an early version of Outlive (not the final version that got published), Peter went to great lengths to describe the cardiorespiratory death as type I death
Then he went into great machinations to talk about the 3 types of decline in healthspan as physical, cognitive, and emotional death
Everybody really pushed back on that (for good reason), and they thought it was a little too morbid to talk about physical death as the death of your exoskeleton and cognitive decline
Peter thinks they were right, that death was probably too strong a word there
His point was: a person can be robbed of all of those things and still be technically alive, although their quality of life has been sapped
Thinks of 3 subvectors of the vector of healthspan: physical health, cognitive health, and emotional health
There are ways we can quantify each of these
Ultimately people will have their own subjective assessment of what it means to be physically healthy or what it means to be cognitively healthy, or what it means to be emotionally healthy
2 of 3 of these subvectors decline with age: the physical and cognitive components
That doesn’t mean that everybody’s decline at the same rate
That doesn’t mean that for everybody, the decline reaches a level that is “pathological”
Peter was thinking about this in the gym today, “Wow, it is really so obvious to me with each passing day that I am completely past my prime physically and cognitively. And I will never again be as physically strong, fit, flexible, free of pain… I will never again reach the pinnacles that I had reached in my late teens and 20s.”
Similarly cognitively, he is a moron compared to the person he used to be in terms of processing speed, problem-solving, raw intellectual horsepower
Those things are going to decline even further
Now, there is more nuance to this because there are certain things physically today that he thinks he actually does better than he did before
In other words, you take advantage of the fact that as you’re getting less explosive, less powerful
You can still maintain strength, and if you learn to move more intelligently, you can actually become more effective
Similarly, as our intelligence transitions from a more fluid form when we’re young to a more crystallized experiential form when we’re older, we still have remarkable ability to contribute
[Peter discussed fluid and crystallized intelligence with Arthur Brooks in episode #226]
There’s no denying that on some of the prime levers against which you would evaluate these, we’re in a state of decline 
Conversely, the 3rd part of healthspan (which is emotional health), it actually doesn’t really tie to age much at all
Depending on how you evaluate it, emotional health almost seems to have a U-shaped curve
Not a really big obvious U, but a dip in, I think statistically, probably the late 40s, and then a gradual rising again
One of the things that Peter always tries to remind himself and his patients is this is something we can really look forward to, provided we do the work: “I can be emotionally better off in a decade than I am today, and I am certainly better off today than I was a decade ago.”
At the highest level, Peter describes longevity as a combination of lifespan and healthspan (comprised of physical, cognitive, and emotional health) 

If your definition of longevity is “I want to live to be 200,” Peter wouldn’t be able to help you 
“The way I think about it is longevity means how do we live longer? I think that means years longer, a decade longer. It doesn’t mean a doubling of lifespan. And how do we reduce the rate of decline of healthspan?”‒ Peter Attia
