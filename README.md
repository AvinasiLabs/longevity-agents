# Longevity-Agents: A Multi-Agent Framework for Personalized Health & Longevity Insights


## Overview

The **Longevity-Agents** is an asynchronous multi-agent framework built to provide personalized health data insights, tailored longevity recommendations, and complex decision-making processes to enhance well-being. It integrates various tools such as web search, domain-specific knowledge retrieval (RAG), code execution, and real-time market data to enable holistic, data-driven health guidance.


## Features


### Achieved

- **Asynchronous Multi-Agent Framework**: A scalable and efficient agent-based system that allows multiple agents to work concurrently to provide personalized health and longevity insights.
  
- **Tool Calling Abilities**: The framework is capable of leveraging external tools for:
  - **Web Search**: Retrieve up-to-date information from the web.
  - **Domain Knowledge Retrieval (RAG)**: Utilize domain-specific knowledge for context-aware reasoning.
  - **Code Execution**: Execute code to perform custom health-related calculations, models, or simulations.
  - **Market Information**: Access real-time data related to the health, wellness, and longevity markets.

- **Longevity Expert Agents**: A set of specialized agents designed to provide advice on longevity based on cutting-edge research and real-time health data.


### Todo

- Framework
    - **Complex Task Execution**: Enhancing the ability of agents to execute more intricate, multi-step tasks requiring complex reasoning and interaction between multiple agents.
    - **Cutting-Edge Reasoning Approaches**: Implement state-of-the-art AI models and reasoning methods to enhance decision-making and provide more accurate and personalized health advice.

- Longevity Data Process
    - **Personalized Health Data Processing with Privacy Security**: Integrate personalized health data (e.g., biometric data from wearables) and process it to generate health reports and insights. 
    - **Personalized Longevity Research Updates**: Keep users updated with the latest research in longevity and health, providing relevant and curated articles or findings.
    - **Social and Environmental Factors Integration**: Analyze how environmental factors (e.g., air quality, water quality, climate) and social factors (e.g., social connections, community engagement) affect user longevity.
    - **Genomic Data Integration**: Incorporate genetic information to offer more personalized health recommendations.

- Customized Personal Health Management
    - **Dietary Recommendation System**: Provide personalized dietary advice based on user health data, goals, and longevity research.
    - **Fitness Plan Generator**: Design personalized workout routines based on user fitness level and longevity goals.
    - **Mental Health and Stress Management**: Offer advice and tools for stress management and mental well-being.
    - **Sleep Optimization**: Optimize the user’s sleep patterns based on their health data and scientific research on sleep.
    - **Long-Term Health Forecasting**: Use machine learning models to predict the user’s long-term health outcomes based on current habits and genetic predisposition.
